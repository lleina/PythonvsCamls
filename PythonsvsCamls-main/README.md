This project, written from scratch in OCaml, utilizes functional programming and graphics to recreate the popular mobile game Plants vs. Zombies.
The goal of the game is to drag and drop camels onto the provided grid as a line fo protection for your code against the nasty Pythons. Camels spit at
the pythons, while cacti generate raindrops which can then be used to purchase more soldiers (similar to the sunshine in the mobile game).

This project contains well over 1500 lines of code and hundreds of test cases, and controls multiple states. We created multiple levels with a basic algorithm
that made the number of pythons to fight per level proportional to the level of difficulty itself.

Examples of gameplay can be seen here:
